Mobile app for collecting feedback on electric vechichle charging lane placement
Sponsored by the Clemson ACS Lab 

The android app tracks the user while they drive using Google Maps API. The app then shows the user's route and provides an alternate route using the user's starting point and destination. The user can compare there route with the alternate route and select which one they think is better. The user's choices and their routes are then stored to a firebase database where they can be used for later research by the ACS Lab.
